# Python-Working-with-Predictive-Analytics

Instructor: Isil Berkun, Data Scientist at Intel Corp.

> This is a LinkedIn course, that I took in December 2020.

Data can tell many stories: where it came from and where it’s going. Predictive analytics gives programmers a tool to tell stories about the future: to extract usable information and make accurate predictions. These predictions, in turn, allow business to make more informed, impactful decisions. Join Isil Berkun, data scientist, to explore predictive analytics with Python. Discover how to prepare data—fill in missing values, perform feature scaling, and more—and use prebuilt Python libraries to make and evaluate prediction models. She describes what models to use when, and explains the concepts in such a way that you can immediately apply them to your own work. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to leverage Python libraries like pandas and NumPy and choose the right prediction models for your projects.

### Learning objectives:

- Explain why data needs to be preprocessed before using predictive models.
- Distinguish between the different predictive models available.

### Skills covered:

- Python (Programming Language)
- Predictive Analytics
- Data Modeling
